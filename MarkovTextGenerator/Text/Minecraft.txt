Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Take your speed potion and put your diamond helmet on
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Closing my Minecraft doors chests are empty.
Check your pickaxe, and may Notch love be with you
This is Diamond Sword to Major Steve
You're gonna find diamonds
And the creepers wanna know if you have much armor
Now it's time to dig straight down if you dare!
This is Major Steve to Diamond Pickaxe
I'm mining some obsidian
And it's taking very long, why does it have to?
And tonight lapis doesn't look like diamonds!
From here I have 16 torches left
Noo more coal!
The mines are getting darker and there's nothing I can do...
Though I've mined almost 100 diamonds, I'm getting very low on health
And I think my diamond pickaxe is about to break!
Please tell Notch I love him very much.
He knows!
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Your sword just broke, there's creepers near!
Can I fight 'till I decease?
Can I fight all these creepers here's a way out
I see some grass
The mine is getting lighter, and I'm almost getting through.
Uh, open up the potions, pop!
It's my mine come on, mine it up!
Hear a hiss behind the door and the night begins
Creepers done this before, I never let 'em in
Pack up your inventory, 'n' we can go out
Bring some extra food so that you don't starve
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring your pickaxe
Yeah, you know where we goin'
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We ain't gonna strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine
When it comes and you know that you wanna stay
Block dirt, let's start mining those real things
Keep those swords in our hands, and open up those potions
Let's fight those mobs, come on slash away
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring a pickaxe
Yeah, we know where we going
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine, we don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine,play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds,we don't gotta dodge lava...
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my...
Welcome to my strip mine, the mine, the cave, the crack
My mine is your mine, treating it right
Sorry if my mine don't have the gold
As soon as I dig down I will find more of that
Oh, my goodness, what is that?
Azul brillante, guapo, so we're going to mine that
I think I know what that is
O.M.G it's diamonds!
Welcome to my mine, we will mine diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't gotta fight mobs
Welcome to my mine, play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine

I don't really care if you mined
On the real you shouldn't have ever died on Minecraft
Should've saw the way she looked at all my ores
She said baby, I am not afraid of creepers
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
Wool, it's all red
It's on my Minecraft house
Like somethin' you ride a minecart down
I just want a head
The creeper got mad
I'm barely on two hearts now
Everybody got the same ores now
Minin' these ores, I'm minin' down
Climbin' the ladder back up to the top
All the way till' my diamonds fall over
Every time that you leave your house
All the zombies like, come on over
I like the way that Steve treat me
Gon' mine ores, get diamonds
I call it that playing Minecraft
She says I am Herobrine
I might blow some TNT, yeah
Healing potion help the pain, yeah
Please, potion make it go away
I'm mining, I am not griefing
But it keeps control of me
All the damage, I can feel it
I swear the potions slowing me
I don't really care if you mined
On the real you shouldn't have ever died on Minecraft
Saw the way she looked at all my ores
She said I am not afraid of, creepers
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead, yeah
All the zombies are dead, yeah
Play Minecraft to cook some raw fish
Because they smell really nasty
Kill some mobs before you get on their plate
So you don't get to feel the pain
And then you craft and mine and dig
To gain experience points ya
And then you strike to get raw pork from pigs
It has no end but it's still the best game
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
Never eat the rotten flesh, it makes you starve in the night
Tame a wolf and train it to play fetch, just don't hit if you want to survive
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
Don't fall into the void it's so odd, when it comes to your days they're the last ones
Israphel he's no evil game mod, just the villain of the great Yogscast
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
"Alright guys, *cough* I'm doing 'Take On Me' now, alright. I, I really, I really like this song, it sounds good."
Minin' away

In this Minecraft day
So beautiful, mine further down
What's that I found?
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)

So far I've got two!
"Ah! *cough*, *cough*, *cough*, *cough*, *sniff*, *cough*

All these diamonds
Sittin' carefully lay
I'm getting worried ("Shut the fucking door!")
If they might get stolen
From my ender chest
Wait, who is that?
Holy sheep, it's Notch!
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Mine diamonds (Take on me)
Now they're safe
Woahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
