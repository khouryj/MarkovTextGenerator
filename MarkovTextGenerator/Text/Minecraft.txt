Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Take your speed potion and put your diamond helmet on
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Closing my Minecraft doors chests are empty.
Check your pickaxe, and may Notch love be with you
This is Diamond Sword to Major Steve
You're gonna find diamonds
And the creepers wanna know if you have much armor
Now it's time to dig straight down if you dare!
This is Major Steve to Diamond Pickaxe
I'm mining some obsidian
And it's taking very long, why does it have to?
And tonight lapis doesn't look like diamonds!
From here I have 16 torches left
Noo more coal!
The mines are getting darker and there's nothing I can do...
Though I've mined almost 100 diamonds, I'm getting very low on health
And I think my diamond pickaxe is about to break!
Please tell Notch I love him very much.
He knows!
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Your sword just broke, there's creepers near!
Can I fight 'till I decease?
Can I fight all these creepers here's a way out
I see some grass
The mine is getting lighter, and I'm almost getting through.
Uh, open up the potions, pop!
It's my mine come on, mine it up!
Hear a hiss behind the door and the night begins
Creepers done this before, I never let 'em in
Pack up your inventory, 'n' we can go out
Bring some extra food so that you don't starve
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring your pickaxe
Yeah, you know where we goin'
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We ain't gonna strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine
When it comes and you know that you wanna stay
Block dirt, let's start mining those real things
Keep those swords in our hands, and open up those potions
Let's fight those mobs, come on slash away
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring a pickaxe
Yeah, we know where we going
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine, we don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine,play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds,we don't gotta dodge lava...
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my...
Welcome to my strip mine, the mine, the cave, the crack
My mine is your mine, treating it right
Sorry if my mine don't have the gold
As soon as I dig down I will find more of that
Oh, my goodness, what is that?
Azul brillante, guapo, so we're going to mine that
I think I know what that is
O.M.G it's diamonds!
Welcome to my mine, we will mine diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't gotta fight mobs
Welcome to my mine, play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine

I don't really care if you mined
On the real you shouldn't have ever died on Minecraft
Should've saw the way she looked at all my ores
She said baby, I am not afraid of creepers
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
Wool, it's all red
It's on my Minecraft house
Like somethin' you ride a minecart down
I just want a head
The creeper got mad
I'm barely on two hearts now
Everybody got the same ores now
Minin' these ores, I'm minin' down
Climbin' the ladder back up to the top
All the way till' my diamonds fall over
Every time that you leave your house
All the zombies like, come on over
I like the way that Steve treat me
Gon' mine ores, get diamonds
I call it that playing Minecraft
She says I am Herobrine
I might blow some TNT, yeah
Healing potion help the pain, yeah
Please, potion make it go away
I'm mining, I am not griefing
But it keeps control of me
All the damage, I can feel it
I swear the potions slowing me
I don't really care if you mined
On the real you shouldn't have ever died on Minecraft
Saw the way she looked at all my ores
She said I am not afraid of, creepers
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead, yeah
All the zombies are dead, yeah
Play Minecraft to cook some raw fish
Because they smell really nasty
Kill some mobs before you get on their plate
So you don't get to feel the pain
And then you craft and mine and dig
To gain experience points ya
And then you strike to get raw pork from pigs
It has no end but it's still the best game
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
Never eat the rotten flesh, it makes you starve in the night
Tame a wolf and train it to play fetch, just don't hit if you want to survive
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
Don't fall into the void it's so odd, when it comes to your days they're the last ones
Israphel he's no evil game mod, just the villain of the great Yogscast
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider

If they might get stolen
From my ender chest

It's soaring past the house and clouds and yeah, you can call that sky block
So come on up and join me
Try to craft a chest that's big enough

I'm minin' while you watchin' like "What texture pack is that?"
I came to dig, dig, dig
Like I don't know to stop
Cause if it shine it's goin' be mine, work overtime
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
Cube casino
Minerals and rocks
Rack 'em, stack 'em, poker chip 'em up
Jewels like lava overflowin' from the top
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
Get off my block
Get off my block
Digging Minecraft style
Minecraft style
Digging a hole, just one more time until I score this
Strike rich on diamonds, iron, gold and build our decked-out fortress
Just hoping for a bit of luck that we must not abort this
Running low, we can't afford this
Dungeons under here
Except last time a group of creepers came out over there
Blew up a vein of diamonds then chased us all out of there
A spider army dropped down from the roof onto our hair
Ran back to fresh air
This ain't your land, you're gonna get banned
So you know (hey)
When you plan to go (hey)
When you're digging, you better listen
So you know (hey)
When they show (hey)
Making sure you're all ready when you go go go go go go go go go go go go go

Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style
Ayyyyyyyyyy sexy piggy!
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
Back on the ground, laying redstone through the forest
To wire our monster traps so all the zombies will ignore us
We built this city block-by-block and we don't welcome tourists
But they still come looking for us
Like a sauna here
We built a portal to the Nether. Lava everywhere
Zombie pigs and ghasts flying all around so tread with care
Best you craft some armor and exchange that for the clothes you wear
While you're under here
Lava flowing. Those lakes are glowing
Down below (hey)
You should go (hey)
But your ready. Your arms are steady
Take the bow (hey)
Shoot the fatal blow (hey)
Run away now cause you missed. You were too slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow

I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay
They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say
One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
And that was when I ruled the land
It was the creepers and skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight
As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
And that was when I ruled the land
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
And that was when I ruled the land
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
Welcome to the world of minecraft
That is full of creepers that will die one day
Boom away
Just because you make sure to lock your door
Doesn't mean you house is safe from creeper gates
You'll never see the creeper sitting next to you
You'll never see the skeleton shooting next to you
You'll think, how did all these of mobs spawn
But after all I've said, please don't forget
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
We don't deal with creepers very well
They say creepers should go to hell
Creepers are noobs just to mention
I'd much rather have a skeleton
You'll never see the creeper trying to kill you
You'll never see the creeper trying to blow you up
You'll think "why are you trying to blow me up?"
After all I've said, please don't forget
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
When I see a creeper I will slay (woof)
The creeper will try hard to get away
The creeper just fell into some lavaaaaaaa
The creeper is now deeeeaaaaaaad
It's deep underground
Past the bedrock
But don't dig straight down
You'll regret that
But now you feel brave
Equipped with your spade
To roam in these caves
Not looking for gold
This stuff's purple
Or so I've been told
By some people
I'll find a few bricks
Where the two of these mix
With a couple of clicks
I'll be swinging my pick
This is all the prep that I go through
Even if my tools are just make-do
I'm moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
Ten blocks is the magical total
As that's enough to build up my portal
Moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
Welcome to hell
Weather's great here
So pull up a chair
Have a cold beer
You can live by the sea
So happy you'll be
With your cobblestone tree
Oh!
The neighbours aren't bright
But delicious
We eat bacon all night
It's nutritious
Hear all of them squeal
From damage I deal
There's plenty to steal
Hack and slash
Golden nuggets; I'm rich!
Who cares if we're giving up sunlight
Glowstone's all we need to keep things bright
Down here in the Nether
We love it in the Nether
You'll love it in the Nether
Don't expect to see any creepers
That's one of my favourite features
Down here in the Nether
We love it in the Nether
You'll love it in the Nether
You gotta know
You have to fight
Learn to play
There's mobs, but it's not night
A wooden sword won't do it
They're gonna blast right through it
You got a potion, use it
So watch your back
I won't warn you twice
Fight that ghast
Ooooooooh!
Make it cry
They shoot the ground around you
Making holes to fall through
You know you're probably going to
And there you go -
- in the lava again!
Feels like hell the things I've just been through
Won't believe a word when I tell you
Know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
Can't believe I lost my new gear too
Think I'd better come and rejoin you
Know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
Got my helmet on my head
Figure out what that zombie said
Lava all over the room
Got a half-heart left, man, I am doomed
Don't have any iron bars
My pick just broke into some shards
Scary noise, what should I do?
Go left or right? I'll have to choose
Visions of last time flash inside my mind
I'm scared, oh well
And I'm pretty sure there's a big creeper right there
Don't mine at night
I know you're lookin' at that cave
And you're feelin' kinda' brave
Go to bed you'll be alright
Don't mine at night
There's nothing that is gonna change
If you just wait until the day
Zombies wanna eat your brains
Don't mine at night
I know it's me you're gonna thank
Make a bed it's not too late
Three wool and three wooden planks
Don't mine at night
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a, woah
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)
Stomach's all tied up in knots
This labyrinth, I'm gettin' lost
This is really getting old
Found like two pieces of coal
Down one way there's just stone
Monsters won't leave me alone
Down another there's some lava
And of course I get pwned
Remember last time I tried to mine at night
I failed, so bad
I lost all my stuff, It was really tough
That's it
Don't mine at night
I know you're lookin' at that cave
And you're feelin' kinda' brave
Go to bed you'll be alright
Don't mine at night
There's nothing that is gonna change
If you just wait until the day
Zombies wanna eat your brains
Don't mine at night
I know it's me you're gonna thank
Make a bed it's not too late
Three wool and three wooden planks
Don't mine at night
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a, woah
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night
Don't mine at night
(Don't mine at night)
Don't mine at night
I know you're lookin' at that cave
And you're feelin' kinda' brave
Go to bed you'll be alright
Don't mine at night
There's nothing that is gonna change
If you just wait until the day
Zombies wanna eat your brains
Don't mine at night
I know it's me you're gonna thank
Make a bed it's not too late
Three wool and three wooden planks
Don't mine at night
How many times I have to say
Drop the pick and walk away-a, woah
My health goes down, I need a cow
I'll find some wheat and one egg now
This sweet, sweet treat
All I need is sugarcane
I'll make some cake
That zombie fell on me, fell on me
Just outta' nowhere, no one tellin' me, tellin' me
Caught off guard with no weaponry, weaponry
I'll stumble off until he can't see me, can't see me
Put a torch up now
Now I'm building with my hands
Make a table out of planks
I'm craftin' if I can
I only have a little time
I don't have time to waste
Wastin' away so wait
What to craft what to make
Think I'll make some cake
My health goes down, I need a cow
I'll find some wheat and one egg now
This sweet, sweet treat
All I need is sugarcane
I'll make some cake
I'll make some cake
C-a-k-e spell for me, spell for me
This cake's so good it tastes so well to me, well to me
It makes me stronger I get well quickly, well quickly
Kill that zombie just like 1-2-3, 1-2-3
Pull my sword out now
Now I'm feelin' like a man
I'll have another piece
I wish I could eat ten
Run out of my cave fire
The fire to kill some mobs
I'll show that zombie who's boss
Then I'll eat his poison steak
With the rest of my cake
My health goes down, I need a cow
I'll find some wheat and one egg now
This sweet, sweet treat
All I need is sugarcane
I'll make some cake
I'll make some cake
We diggin' all the time and you know we won't stop
We getting' diamonds man
Yea you know them big rocks
You playing peaceful while I'm the school of hard knocks
Grew fighting every day
Call that Survival Block
Creepers trying' to do me dirty they won't sssmirk long
Just ask CaptainSparklez about that forged diamond sword
Just ask the Nanner man, Shwarzenegger Arnold, there's no point in running man
What you think this arrows for?
Sky's the limit we be building' this is our home
Another day, another structure, world that we own
There's no griefin' here cause you see that gravel road?
I'll leave it painted with your blood. Red stone
And I'll be building whole cities. What do you know?
You still stuck playing with your daddies legos
I'm getting' busy Diggy Diggy like Blue Xephos
A step ahead, another class, always a Notch above
You make a shack to live in
I make the Taj Mahal
You choppin' down a tree
I made a Pokeball
You are soft break apart like a clay block
I'm solid like a golden ore
I got this game on lock
I came to dig
If you're crafting and you know it put your hands in the air
Wanna see you swing that pick axe like you don't really care
Came to dig, do it big
Block Billionaire
If you're crafting and you know it put your hands in the air
Oh no this again
Gotta take a sec kill a pig again
Dealing with a creeper and he's hiss-hissin'
And I'm gonna get revenge like a tune I'm in
We're a father son relationship
I'm the block and you're just the chip
And these boxes are my currency
So I'm always stacking mine like Pringle chips
From the sea and to the desert this is my reality
From the caves until the nether it's my world to oversee
This might seem like something special but we do this everyday
This is my land, made with my hands
This is Minecraft and
[Swing the axe on]
When you get down in the mine
You gotta dig the dirt up
You gotta dig the dirt up
You gotta dig the dirt up
What we lookin' to find
Diamonds or bust
Diamonds or bust
Diamonds or bust
See the mobs in the mine
They watching us
They watching us
They watching us
Then I see them in a line
Now mine I must
Now mine I must
Now mine I must
I'm gonna scream and shout, and mine it all out
And scream and shout, and mine it out
We saying, oh Steve oh Steve oh Steve oh

Gotta go, this whole place is outta control
At the bottom you just don't know
Which way is out, where do I go - no no [hey, yo]
See the light, now let's hit the door
Climb it up, and then climb some more
Flint it up, and then watch it blow, blow, blow [let's, go]
Made it out, got it now
Now this is what I'm talking 'bout
Pack it up, and back to the house, hou-hooouse [let's, go]
Craft it up, and hold it up high
Here we go, them Creepers gon' die

Oh yeah....

Oh yeah....
I re-spawn, respawn, respawn respawn
When you blow me up to the Aether
I thought my hearts would last forever
But then you struck me down, now I'm a regretter
So maybe I re-spawn, respawn, respawn respawn
And this time I'm gonna do better
I wish this sword would last forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
I'm gonna scream and shout, and take them all out
And scream and shout, and wipe them out
We saying, oh Steve oh Steve oh Steve oh

(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
Here am I in this, world of mine I just keep pacin' the floor
There's this guy and he, keeps on buildin' things and slammin' my door
He's been in my dreams, and I'm sure I've seen him hauntin' before
Herobrine ain't real, but I know that I can't take this no more, yeah
But oh man here we go again, here we go again doin' what you do
Yeah I stopped pretendin' it, pretendin' it's not really you
No I don't wanna believe, wanna believe that it's all true
But here I'm so terrified, so terrified, oh man I'm through
So I cross my world, and I know tonight,
that you're always gonna give me one more fright
And yeah I've denied it a million times
But I know you're gonna give me one more fright
Trying to run away, but somehow I keep on seeing you 'round
If it's not a hole, in the wall you've put a redstone torch down
Every day I find, myself always checking behind my back
Lava everywhere, yeah I wish I could say it was a hack, yeah
But oh man here we go again, here we go again doin' what you do (doin' what you do)
Yeah I stopped pretendin' it, pretendin' it's not really you (not really you)
No I don't wanna believe, wanna believe that it's all true (that it's all true, yeah)
But here I'm so terrified, so terrified, oh man I'm throug
So I cross my world, and I know tonight,

(Nah. he ain't real...)
Picks not good enough for Steve
Since I've mined with you, ooh
It's not gonna mine these ores
No enchant can equal it
I'm gonna sip on this potion, when I'm in the cave
I should've known how to brew it
I'm gonna get all the Lapis
Will creepers push up against Steve, ooh, will it explode?
I had enough bookshelves for 30 enchant
I peep'd you from across the screen
Nice little enchant and mining like a good pick
And you are unbreakable
I need to get you in a cave
Why mine? a great pickaxe never hurt nobody
I got a couple torches but it's not charcoal
If you loved iron then I'm so, so sorry
I gotta give her emeralds like we're villagers
Oh, like we're in the nether
No, no, I will tell no creepers
You're on level 32
Tryna do what Minecrafter's do
Feelin' like I'm fresh outta diamonds
If they want the diamonds get the bow and arrow
Ship the whole MC gang to a wood boat
Doin' stuff that you don't even see in let's plays
Mine with me, mine with me, Notch
I got a hard [?] wool soft
Alex want the diamonds with enchants on it
'Cause I pulled up with the bookshelf and told her enchant it
And you are unbreakable
I need to get you in a cave
Now you wanna mine
Just popped a potion in the lava
Picks not good enough for Steve
Since I've mined with you, ooh
It's not gonna mine these ores
No enchant can equal it
I'm gonna sip on this potion, when I'm in the cave
I should've known how to brew it
I'm gonna get all the Lapis
Will creepers push up against Steve, ooh, will it explode?
I had enough bookshelves for 30 enchant

Oh, like we're in the nether
No, no, I will tell no creepers
You're on level 32
Tryna do what Minecrafter's do
You ain't enough for Steve
Too much for a Alex, alone
Now let's go grab some more Lapis, bring 'em home
Know the bookshelves on me
I'ma kill these cows for you, you know
So pick up that Lapis for me
Leave all the redstone
Too much bookshelf for 30 enchant
[?] 24 diamonds
She left her pick at home
She don't mine ores no more
Look, if you mined one iron, or one diamond ore
To get all the ores you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you mine it or just let it fall in lava?
Yo, his pick is sweaty, boots weak, stone is heavy
There's arrows in his Steve already, Steve's diamond ores
He's mining, but on the Minecraft, Steve is getting diamonds
To drop TNT, but Steve keeps on mining all the iron
The creepers hiss so loud, he takes out his pick
But the ores won't come out
Picks broken, how? All the creepers blowin' up
The potions run out, creepers come blowin' up
Snap back to these diamond ores, oh, there goes iron ores, oh
There goes Redstone, he mines, he's on Minecraft, he won't
Lose his diamond ores, no, he won't craft it, he knows
He Minecrafted his ores, it don't matter, he's Steve
He knows that but he's got a diamond, he's Herobrine and he knows
When he goes back to his Minecraft house, that's when it's
Back to the Mineshaft again, yo! His whole Minecraft city
Better go capture these diamonds and hope that they don't fall in lava
You better mine some diamonds in the mineshaft
The moment, you mine it, you better never drop your ores
You only get one pick, do not miss your chance to mine
These diamond ores come once in a Minecraft lifetime
You'd better mine some diamonds in the mineshaft
The moment, you mine it, you better never drop your ores
You only get one pick, do not miss your chance to mine
These diamond ores come once in a Minecraft lifetime
His pigs are escaping through this fence that is gaping
This world is mine for the crafting, make me Notch
As we move toward a Minecraft update
A normal Minecraft's boring; but Minecraft mods
Are close to a new game, I turn it to the hard game mode
Steve grows home and blows up TNT, it's all over
These zombies are all on him, mine to mine ores
He's known as the best miner, lonely caves Minecraft
It snows, he's grown wheat and at home he's no creeper
He goes home and barely knows his own tame wolves
But hold your bow, ‘cause Steve jumps in the cold water
These zombies don't want him no more, he's just iron
They moved on to the next Steve who mines
He went to the village, and sold some stuff
Is so, the diamond ores, I click play, it loads
I suppose it's the old Minecraft
But the pick goes on like mine, mine, mine, mine
You better mine some diamonds in the mineshaft
The moment, you mine it, you better never drop your ores
You only get one pick, do not miss your chance to mine
These diamond ores come once in a Minecraft lifetime
You better mine some diamonds in the mine shaft
The moment, you mine it, you better never drop your ores
You only get one pick, do not miss your chance to mine
These diamond ores come once in a Minecraft lifetime
Minecraft games, I'ma change what you call mining
Break this Minecraft house off like two wolves fenced
I was mining in the beginning, but Minecraft changed
I've been blown up and shot at and ate my brains
But I kept crafting and stepped right in the mineshaft
Best believe somebody's paying the villagers
All the damage on Steve amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my iron
Ores, and I can't mine the right diamonds
I Minecraft for my Steve, he's in Steve, it's Minecraft
Can't mine obsidian, and no it's no Minecraft let's play
There's no commentary, this is my Minecraft world
It's so hard, and Minecraft is getting harder
Tryin' to mine and craft doors on Minecraft
Plus brew and farm, caught up between being a crafter and a creeper, zombies tryin' to kill me, screaming ghast in the nether, too much for Steve to stay in one Mineshaft, another day of Minecraft's gotten me to the surface
I'm like a cow, I gotta craft a new pick, or end up in the nether or end, finding diamonds is my only Minecraft option, Iron's not, Steve I love you but this iron's got to go, I can not mine ores in this Mineshaft, so Steve here goes my mine, Minecraft all day, this might be the only Minecraft diamond ore that I got!
You better mine some diamonds in the mineshaft
The moment, you mine it, you better never drop your ores
You only get one pick, do not miss your chance to mine
These diamond ores come once in a Minecraft lifetime
You better mine some diamonds in the mine shaft
The moment, you mine it, you better never drop your ores
You only get one pick, do not miss your chance to mine
These diamond ores come once in a Minecraft lifetime, you better
