Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Take your speed potion and put your diamond helmet on
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Closing my Minecraft doors chests are empty.
Check your pickaxe, and may Notch love be with you
This is Diamond Sword to Major Steve
You're gonna find diamonds
And the creepers wanna know if you have much armor
Now it's time to dig straight down if you dare!
This is Major Steve to Diamond Pickaxe
I'm mining some obsidian
And it's taking very long, why does it have to?
And tonight lapis doesn't look like diamonds!
From here I have 16 torches left
Noo more coal!
The mines are getting darker and there's nothing I can do...
Though I've mined almost 100 diamonds, I'm getting very low on health
And I think my diamond pickaxe is about to break!
Please tell Notch I love him very much.
He knows!
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Your sword just broke, there's creepers near!
Can I fight 'till I decease?
Can I fight all these creepers here's a way out
I see some grass
The mine is getting lighter, and I'm almost getting through.
Uh, open up the potions, pop!
It's my mine come on, mine it up!
Hear a hiss behind the door and the night begins
Creepers done this before, I never let 'em in
Pack up your inventory, 'n' we can go out
Bring some extra food so that you don't starve
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring your pickaxe
Yeah, you know where we goin'
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We ain't gonna strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine
When it comes and you know that you wanna stay
Block dirt, let's start mining those real things
Keep those swords in our hands, and open up those potions
Let's fight those mobs, come on slash away
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring a pickaxe
Yeah, we know where we going
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine, we don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine,play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds,we don't gotta dodge lava...
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my...
Welcome to my strip mine, the mine, the cave, the crack
My mine is your mine, treating it right
Sorry if my mine don't have the gold
As soon as I dig down I will find more of that
Oh, my goodness, what is that?
Azul brillante, guapo, so we're going to mine that
I think I know what that is
O.M.G it's diamonds!
Welcome to my mine, we will mine diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't gotta fight mobs
Welcome to my mine, play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine

It's mining on when the cave is dark and seeing ores in the lava pits
Stare at the enderman
Finally knowing it'll kill you
I know that you'll thank Notch, you did
I know where you've mined, where you mine, where you're minin'
