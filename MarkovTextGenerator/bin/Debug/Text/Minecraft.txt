Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Take your speed potion and put your diamond helmet on
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Closing my Minecraft doors chests are empty.
Check your pickaxe, and may Notch love be with you
This is Diamond Sword to Major Steve
You're gonna find diamonds
And the creepers wanna know if you have much armor
Now it's time to dig straight down if you dare!
This is Major Steve to Diamond Pickaxe
I'm mining some obsidian
And it's taking very long, why does it have to?
And tonight lapis doesn't look like diamonds!
From here I have 16 torches left
Noo more coal!
The mines are getting darker and there's nothing I can do...
Though I've mined almost 100 diamonds, I'm getting very low on health
And I think my diamond pickaxe is about to break!
Please tell Notch I love him very much.
He knows!
Diamond Sword to Major Steve
Your sword just broke, there's creepers near!
Can I fight 'till I decease?
Can I fight all these creepers here's a way out
I see some grass
The mine is getting lighter, and I'm almost getting through.
Uh, open up the potions, pop!
It's my mine come on, mine it up!
Hear a hiss behind the door and the night begins
Creepers done this before, I never let 'em in
Pack up your inventory, 'n' we can go out
Bring some extra food so that you don't starve
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring your pickaxe
Yeah, you know where we goin'
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We ain't gonna strip mine
We don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine
Play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine
When it comes and you know that you wanna stay
Block dirt, let's start mining those real things
Keep those swords in our hands, and open up those potions
Let's fight those mobs, come on slash away
Sometimes you forget torches
And you gotta bring a pickaxe
Yeah, we know where we going
Sometimes you forget torches
Welcome to my mine, we are mining diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine, we don't have to fight mobs
Welcome to my mine,play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds,we don't gotta dodge lava...
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my...
Welcome to my strip mine, the mine, the cave, the crack
My mine is your mine, treating it right
Sorry if my mine don't have the gold
As soon as I dig down I will find more of that
Oh, my goodness, what is that?
Azul brillante, guapo, so we're going to mine that
I think I know what that is
O.M.G it's diamonds!
Welcome to my mine, we will mine diamonds
We don't gotta strip mine
We don't gotta fight mobs
Welcome to my mine, play that noteblock nicely
Show me all those emeralds
We don't gotta dodge lava
Welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine, welcome to my mine

I don't really care if you mined
On the real you shouldn't have ever died on Minecraft
Should've saw the way she looked at all my ores
She said baby, I am not afraid of creepers
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
Wool, it's all red
It's on my Minecraft house
Like somethin' you ride a minecart down
I just want a head
The creeper got mad
I'm barely on two hearts now
Everybody got the same ores now
Minin' these ores, I'm minin' down
Climbin' the ladder back up to the top
All the way till' my diamonds fall over
Every time that you leave your house
All the zombies like, come on over
I like the way that Steve treat me
Gon' mine ores, get diamonds
I call it that playing Minecraft
She says I am Herobrine
I might blow some TNT, yeah
Healing potion help the pain, yeah
Please, potion make it go away
I'm mining, I am not griefing
But it keeps control of me
All the damage, I can feel it
I swear the potions slowing me
I don't really care if you mined
On the real you shouldn't have ever died on Minecraft
Saw the way she looked at all my ores
She said I am not afraid of, creepers
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead
Push me off the mountain
Push me off the mountain
All the zombies are dead, yeah
All the zombies are dead, yeah
Play Minecraft to cook some raw fish
Because they smell really nasty
Kill some mobs before you get on their plate
So you don't get to feel the pain
And then you craft and mine and dig
To gain experience points ya
And then you strike to get raw pork from pigs
It has no end but it's still the best game
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
Never eat the rotten flesh, it makes you starve in the night
Tame a wolf and train it to play fetch, just don't hit if you want to survive
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
Don't fall into the void it's so odd, when it comes to your days they're the last ones
Israphel he's no evil game mod, just the villain of the great Yogscast
It's the eye of the spider, it's poison in one bite
Oh look out, I'm an excellent fighter
The creepers and the zombies other mobs of the night
Spiders give you some string and the eye, of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
The eye of the spider
"Alright guys, *cough* I'm doing 'Take On Me' now, alright. I, I really, I really like this song, it sounds good."

While you got the whole server like "You even dig bro?" (I dig!)
A self-made block billionaire, just check the map
I'm minin' while you watchin' like "What texture pack is that?"
I came to dig, dig, dig
Like I don't know to stop
Cause if it shine it's goin' be mine, work overtime
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
(H-h-h-here's a one way trip ticket for one)
Get off my block
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
Cube casino
Minerals and rocks
Rack 'em, stack 'em, poker chip 'em up
Jewels like lava overflowin' from the top
Chest stuck on overstock like everyday
Get off my block
Get off my block
Get off my block
Digging Minecraft style
Minecraft style
Digging a hole, just one more time until I score this
Strike rich on diamonds, iron, gold and build our decked-out fortress
Just hoping for a bit of luck that we must not abort this
Running low, we can't afford this
Dungeons under here
Except last time a group of creepers came out over there
Blew up a vein of diamonds then chased us all out of there
A spider army dropped down from the roof onto our hair
Ran back to fresh air
This ain't your land, you're gonna get banned
So you know (hey)
When you plan to go (hey)
When you're digging, you better listen
So you know (hey)
When they show (hey)
Making sure you're all ready when you go go go go go go go go go go go go go

Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig, digging Minecraft style
Ayyyyyyyyyy sexy piggy!
Dig, dig, dig, dig, dig
Back on the ground, laying redstone through the forest
To wire our monster traps so all the zombies will ignore us
We built this city block-by-block and we don't welcome tourists
But they still come looking for us
Like a sauna here
We built a portal to the Nether. Lava everywhere
Zombie pigs and ghasts flying all around so tread with care
Best you craft some armor and exchange that for the clothes you wear
While you're under here
Lava flowing. Those lakes are glowing
Down below (hey)
You should go (hey)
But your ready. Your arms are steady
Take the bow (hey)
Shoot the fatal blow (hey)
Run away now cause you missed. You were too slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow, slow

Until you hit the core
Diamonds diamonds baby that's what we're all looking for
Dig some more
Until you hit the core
When you find them then you know it's time to soar
Ain't a game we're playing

I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay
They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say
One minute we had it all
Next our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
And that was when I ruled the land
It was the creepers and skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight
As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why is it that I wasn't dead
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
And that was when I ruled the land
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Noteblock choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn 'round pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
And that was when I ruled the land
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
Welcome to the world of minecraft
That is full of creepers that will die one day
Boom away
Just because you make sure to lock your door
Doesn't mean you house is safe from creeper gates
You'll never see the creeper sitting next to you
You'll never see the skeleton shooting next to you
You'll think, how did all these of mobs spawn
But after all I've said, please don't forget
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
We don't deal with creepers very well
They say creepers should go to hell
Creepers are noobs just to mention
I'd much rather have a skeleton
You'll never see the creeper trying to kill you
You'll never see the creeper trying to blow you up
You'll think "why are you trying to blow me up?"
After all I've said, please don't forget
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
Please don't make any sudden moooooooves
The creepers they might just go boom boooooooom
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
All my friends are creepers, they explooooooode
Get too close they might explode your hooooooome
When I see a creeper I will slay (woof)
The creeper will try hard to get away
The creeper just fell into some lavaaaaaaa
The creeper is now deeeeaaaaaaad
It's deep underground
Past the bedrock
But don't dig straight down
You'll regret that
But now you feel brave
Equipped with your spade
To roam in these caves
Not looking for gold
This stuff's purple
Or so I've been told
By some people
I'll find a few bricks
Where the two of these mix
With a couple of clicks
I'll be swinging my pick
This is all the prep that I go through
Even if my tools are just make-do
I'm moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
Ten blocks is the magical total
As that's enough to build up my portal
Moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
I'm moving to the Nether
Welcome to hell
Weather's great here
So pull up a chair
Have a cold beer
You can live by the sea
So happy you'll be
With your cobblestone tree
Oh!
The neighbours aren't bright
But delicious
We eat bacon all night
It's nutritious
Hear all of them squeal
From damage I deal
There's plenty to steal
Hack and slash
Golden nuggets; I'm rich!
Who cares if we're giving up sunlight
Glowstone's all we need to keep things bright
Down here in the Nether
We love it in the Nether
You'll love it in the Nether
Don't expect to see any creepers
That's one of my favourite features
Down here in the Nether
We love it in the Nether
You'll love it in the Nether
You gotta know
You have to fight
Learn to play
There's mobs, but it's not night
A wooden sword won't do it
They're gonna blast right through it
You got a potion, use it
So watch your back
I won't warn you twice
Fight that ghast
Ooooooooh!
Make it cry
They shoot the ground around you
Making holes to fall through
You know you're probably going to
And there you go -
- in the lava again!
Feels like hell the things I've just been through
Won't believe a word when I tell you
Know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
Can't believe I lost my new gear too
Think I'd better come and rejoin you
Know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
You know what? Screw the Nether
